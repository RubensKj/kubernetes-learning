# Stress API

To stress the api and see if the application works with HPA, you can use the `stress.sh` file.

### Execute Stress.sh file

If you're in Git Bash terminal you can run by this way
Should use like this `./FILE_NAME.sh TIME_IN_SECONDS > FILE_OUT_NAME`

`FILE_NAME.sh` will be stress.sh
`TIME_IN_SECONDS`, in case you want a real stress, put 0.001
`FILE_OUT_NAME` will be the name of the output file, that can be `out.txt`
